VanPyZ futures talks
====================

* Henry Precheur: 
  + [WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)](http://wsgi.org/wsgi/): WSGI powers all modern Python web frameworks. It provides a unified way to talk HTTP. (Talk can be 30 mins to 1h30 long.)
  + [SQLAchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/): The SQLAlchemy SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper is a comprehensive set of tools for working with databases and Python.
* Dethe Elza [ReportLab](http://www.reportlab.org/)
* Doug Latornell: 
  + I've been looking at [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) for a potential project at work. I haven't delved too deeply yet, but if the project gets the go-ahead, I should be able to talk about CouchDB in, say, January, or February. This one would likely be about 30 minutes too, but it depends how much I know when I do it, and how many questions people have.
