The Canberra Python Users Group
===============================

**We meet on (mostly) the first Thursday of every month at 6pm** 

We're a friendly mixed bunch of Canberrans old and new -- all skill levels and disciplines welcome. 

The responsible parties are [Jonah Sullivan](mailto:jonahsullivan79@gmail.com), [Alex Ware](mailto:alex.g.ware@gmail.com) and [Elena Williams](mailto:cpug@elena.net.au) along with a number of other Python folk. Feel free to contact any of us with questions. 

Importantly if you have an idea for a talk, we'd love to hear about it. 

Meetings
--------

Upcoming meetings and reminders are posted to the meetup group: <https://www.meetup.com/canberra-python-meetup-group/> 

Proudly we over-represent for such a small city and foster a community or engineers, coders and python programmers of all colours and flavours. 

Join our slack here: <https://join.slack.com/t/canberrapug/shared_invite/zt-50v7p9g3-PnlGqMFr2LumH_dNizyWfg> 

Also for luck: <https://github.com/canberra-python/README> 

Venue
-----

Hannah Neumann Building #145, Seminar Room 1.33, ANU, Acton, Canberra, Australia 

Being a university it's a maze, give yourself plenty of time the first time you're trying to find the room. The room has external windows, next to the sliding doors on the Eastern side of the building where you should be able to see the group. 

Occassionally we need to mix up the date and space, see the meetup group for details. 

Food
----

Pizza and drinks are generously provided by Reposit Power, Xero and Linux Australia. 

Topics
------

We are always after new speakers, don't be shy! Everyone in the room wants to hear about your experiences and is there to learn something cool. It is a low pressure, supportive environment to present at. 

Please contact [Jonah Sullivan](mailto:jonahsullivan79@gmail.com) if you would like to schedule a presentation.
