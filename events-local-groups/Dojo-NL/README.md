Dojo-NL is the homepage coding dojo's taking place in the Netherlands. The Dojo was started as an idea at a [PUN](https://github.com/elena/python-wiki-replica/blob/main/events-local-groups/PUN) meeting. 

If you've never heard of a coding dojo see these links: [What Is A Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo), [Coding Dojo](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gpollice/Dojo.html). This information will give you an idea of what a Dojo is however, there are many different forms. If you want to code, and meet other coder's and enhance your skills while enhancing the skills of others then the dojo is for you!
