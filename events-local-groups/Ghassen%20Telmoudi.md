Unfortunately only few people have heard about python in Tunisia, and that because programming courses are given in Pascal in high schools, and in C++ and Java in Universities. As we're in Africa, evolution is not the best subject that our governments to be concern about. So if we wait for change we will need at least another 20 years to see python in Schools. For this matter I decided to build this community around python that I named Python Tunisia. I hope everybody join me to spread python, while breathing the air of freedom after 23 years of dictatorship.
