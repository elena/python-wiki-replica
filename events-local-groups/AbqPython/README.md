AbqPython is the local Python user's group in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
======================================================================

This group is mainly organized as a MeetUp group: <http://www.meetup.com/AbqPython/>. We generally meet on the first Tuesday of the month. See the Meetup page for upcoming events and meeting details (the location sometimes changes). 

We also have a listserv. To sign up, visit <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/abqpy>. 

Members are encouraged to get themselves into [the editor's group of this Wiki](/moin/FrontPage#use) and to create their own pages to serve as a home for their Python (and other) notes and to contribute to this page and pages under it.
