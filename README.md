**It seems to be the year of the python wiki!** Independently it seems as though several people/groups have got an interest in this wiki. I am one of those people, though it is only now it's coming to light how many people were interested.

For myself, I wanted to get an understanding of what the wiki "looked Like" to do some analysis on.

Additionally it seemed like fun to see if it was replicable here, using the default wiki available with this tooling, so here we are.
