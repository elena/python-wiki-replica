# Replica of Python Wiki

OriginaL: https://wiki.python.org/

**It seems to be the year of the python wiki!** Independently it seems as though several people/groups have got an interest in this wiki. I am one of those people, though it is only now it's coming to light how many people were interested.

I have tremendous respect for the wiki and everyone who has worked on it. Some names appear again and again over many years, it's clear a great deal of effort and work has been put in to this resource. 

My motive here is that I want to have a community-driven "source of truth" for a bunch of the information in this resource, particularly the user-groups (where my magnificent Australian community has over-represented here) and I want to push this further. It's been on my mind for some time that the existing moin instance does seem to struggle with resiliance and simultaneously this here github seems to be growing as a tool that many people are familiar with, which also supports the "wiki" concept. 

This project is an attempt to do a swift port to a github repo. It has been about as much work expected and I'm exceptionally grateful for some fantastic tooling from the python ecosystem that has made this both quick and quite fun (nb no llms were used outside of editor-code-completion, which didn't necessarily make things faster). 

--

NEXT: To reach out to the owners of the moin instance and get their advice. Contact has already been made via discord and mailing list, but this project is well on track to be mature, with the hardest parts of the work done. For disclosure, I'm now feeling quite nervous about this, but yolo and also it'd be a shame to see this effort go to waste.

Ideally this version of the python wiki can be accepted at least informally and "real" work can be started to build upon it, there's still tons to do. I for one and now busting to update the details on my main UG.

I will be pursuing this follow-up during w/c 2025-02-17

Rollercoaster.

Things have changed. Adam Turner has announced in python-docs discord his export (I was aware that he was interested in the space but not that he had active wip): 

> Iâ€™ve published https://github.com/AA-Turner/python-wiki/, an effectively-static mirror of the Python & Jython wiki. The semi-private PSF wiki is excluded for now. No conversion has been done, the text files are simply the raw MoinMoin wiki syntax.

It took me a minute to warm up to it, but I've moved from trepidatious to warm to enthusiastic in short order.

TBH, before this having come across the PageViews page as at this morning I'd be considering going back to the drawing-board somewhat and briefly step back again to a "planning stage". 

With this new announcement I'm necessarily back-back to the drawing-board, in a good way. My work so far is far from completely thrown out though it all does need a significant re-think. I'm so keen to dig in to that new repo and analyse it, it's some genuinely cool work. Yum.

Knee-jerk tasks for now:

* Compare aat-repo files with sections/groups
* Get in to analysis: content-size
* Get in to analysis: page-views
* Consider "Category" prefix  pages
* Unroll commits and do some analysis/matching
* Review matched/not/anon contributors


New end is per my response to the thread:

> Overall I'd just love to have an active information/details  "source of truth" that the whole community feels empowered to contribute to.

As far as I'm concerned the specifics of how this end is achieved aren't as important as the end itself.

I am extremely keen to publish this work. My responsibilities on the Linux Australia steering committee and teaching the ANU Computing students are ramping up this week (in addition to my full-time senior software engineering/architecting day-job), but this work is still a priority so I will keep chipping away.

I have the teaching of Bent Flyvbjerg at the fore of my mind.

Well. Well. Well.

Really digging in to the mopping up phase and have come across many "automatically generated" pages that are fascinating.

* The holy grail of number page views per page
* The deeply untrustworthy page of abandoned pages (which contains, among many other the 11th most popular page last update in 2022; and `cpython`)
* The "I'm not salty about this" page that is instructions on how to do a full data dump from cli (though a full dump apparently may contain private pages, of where I've found a link for 1 which was financial for a con from the noughts)

Most interesting are the pages that are locked down from being edited, I'm just so curious about the rationale ðŸ¤”.

These extra signals are helpful, I'm still sticking to my plan.

Checking ever single `404` as discussed below: 3,616 of them. At this minute 2,824/3,616 `404` links are checked so not too far to go. I did start this on th 19th so statistically this won't complete today (it's seriously slow).


Here are the last 2x FYI:
```
2823 moin/XmlRpcLib 404
Calling: https://wiki.python.org/moin/QtDbus
2824 moin/QtDbus 404
Calling: https://wiki.python.org/moin/DateTimes
```

Current planned layout for this repo:

```
`beginner-tutorials`

`events-major`

`lists-links-external`
`lists-books-topical`
`lists-books-international`

`psf-internal`

`reference-technical`
`reference-international`

`regional-local-groups`
`regional-organisations`

`users`

`.historical-pages`

`.wiki.python.org_mirror/credits.md`
`.wiki.python.org_mirror/moin/`
`.wiki.python.org_mirror/scripts/`
```

There is currently no good "source or truth" for regional organisations. We've done a bunch of work on this recently and I can't think of a better place to add it than here, further I still am itching to update my own personal local group and region.


TODO (before pushing the above layout, which more-or-less exists for me locally):

* Revision/checks handling models (this was further down the list but accidently just did it just now, I do love this kind of data management/organising and django it's just too easy and nice)
* Finish running `404` checks
* Final recurse links checks
* Mop up stragglers
* Finish tidying "mirror" html (this is a bit unwieldly, no one like a directory with just thousands of sub-directories, but this is what we've got)

Stretch/next:

* Decide what to do about broken links (2x distinct problem spaces: internal; external)
* scripts
* credits work


NB: found new status code: `403` which is no worries. 

Probably will manage links later. I'm keen to get this work to https://github.com/python-organizers/ when it's far enough along. 


**Original Wiki Mirror**

There's work continuing to be done on the original -- the plan here initially _was_ just to straight up mirror this, which will be done but just one subdirectory down.

The cadence of updates is easy enough for me to keep up with, I'll tidy up the script for "getting", it's trivial, basically `request` + `open`. This is the traditional nerd solution. The difficult adult solution is to follow through and talk to the people doing the updates, but this is another task for a future day.

**Credits**

A "leaderboard"/"credits" among registered users has emerged quite trivially. I'll do more work before adding it as an actual file, and will improve the scripts surrounding this (though this below is literally copied from django ui with some trivial postprocessing).

Quick list of 3+ pages where this User was the last who edited it. Anon contributions have been filtered out, though the first anon account came in 9th (with 20 pages).

Notes:

* This is still misrepresentation! This is only **last edited**, doesn't reflect full contribution history (that's a different, yet unfinished, piece of work, delayed by `404` shennanigans)
* `localhost` is all the pages from 2008 and earlier, that are the move to the current platform
* Possible incorrect but I think `DaleAthanasias` may be `techtonik` if so, they deserves some serious credit here, though the last contribution for both to this community was some time ago ðŸ˜¢
* Finally many "usual suspects" in this list, though several people here are literal friends of mine âœ¨

Still recursing. (busy at work and other volunteering commitments and just being a person with a life)

At this minute there are 309 new links to still check.

The bottleneck is sending request to original site (very slow, often 70-120 seconds). It crashes _pretty_ easily. You can send maybe 5-8 requests and then it'll just 503. It's always done this afaik and it puts forward a good case for doing something about the problematic infra/hosting.

Posted to discord. Engagement is low. Changed licence based on feedback from Adam Turner. Soft deadline of having something kind of decently formed by 2025-02-24 as may be knocking heads with some like minds at that time and would be delighted to share the new resource then.

--

_Attempted shortcut -- a bit of a failure: `404`s/`nonexistant`_

`404`s/broken-links generally can only be determined by making a request to original wiki, and then a page is returned doesn't have the status  `404`, but has the speculative text: "This page does not exist yet. You can create a new empty page, or use one of the page templates. Before creating the page, please check if a similar page already exists.", and no authorship. User pages are a great example of this, for example the grey v. blue link names here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/RecentChanges

Wiki is very aggressive at proliferating links. The ratio of real(`200`):speculative(`404`) is right now 3139:3616 which is >53% are not "real" pages with actual content.

Thought it might be "smart"/easy to scan existing pages for instances where links from existing pages had linked to these `404` pages and the class was added called "nonexistent" which would render the link differently for the different (grey v. blue) CSS effect. The wiki would be checking itself internally (swiftly on the same server) to know at render-time if the locally linked page existed or not right? Right?

Quick sampling post-hoc determined this was giving false-positives, so a range of links have been marked as `404` where they are actually real. Yeah, I guess it makes sense that this is calculated only the last time the page was updated. When I asked for a "data dump" from the docs wiki they told me that such a thing didn't exist and that it's all files which would track with this. Not sure what the scope is but my intuition is that it's not huge as it's only pages that have been created after the linking page was last updated. I can probably do another pass to determine if the page is "existent" any time later. Realistically I'll just try to re-get the however-many-thousands that have been flagged `404` some time after they've all been at least touched once, and then a correction process to add missing pages if necessary. Sure no worries. I'll have to check for recent updates anyway and I want to add the history entirely for some of the pages anyway so plenty more hitting the remote is in front of me. This is fine

--

Tallying forth. Feeling good. The plan hasn't changed.

---

2025-02-16:

First pass is complete. 

There are 1,751 "root" pages by default.

This are grouped to:

```
`beginner-tutorials` (15)
`reference-technical` (108)
`reference-international` (89)

`events-major` (82)
`events-local-groups` (31)

`lists-links-external` (14)
`lists-books-topical` (14)
`lists-books-international` (13)

`psf-wiki-internal` (25)
`users` (474)
`historical-pages` (rest)
```

This is still rough but care has been taken to select these root categories based on past decades of use. Some inspiration was taken from the existing "Category____" setup: https://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontPage?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=Category&titlesearch=Titles  -- the balance applied here feels good, fair and appropriate.

A few "design decision" things are in my way currently:

* Links management
  * Some are broken. Link management will be perenniel. Further down the track some kind of automation can by applied to assist in managing this. Maybe precommit-hook.
* âœ… github/wiki experiment (failed): github wiki appears to be "flat", ie, it doesn't support wiki with directory/tree structure as moin does. Fallen back to using the main repo.
* Preserving history
  * Can see many approaches but developing the idea
 
The final mopping up after the above are resolved is to upload the workings. These are:

* local django wip project including db.sqlite3 db (or data dumps?)
* full dump of md conversion
* original collected html files

**TODO:**

* Reach out to people who appear to be owners of existing 
* Process newly collected (no wait, another 99 have fallen out, love-a-spider)
  * keep recursing until done
  * apply groups (could document loose rules used? vaguely: pull out users/local-groups/events/books/i18n; arrange by date, eyeball most recent for annotation saying explicitly that historical; categorise remaining)
* Check for any changes since 2025-02-09 (and apply)
* Update links back to original site for generated pages (can't move)
* Write out all to repo and commit (to this repo here)
* Talk to https://github.com/python-organizers/ about maybe setting up shop there?
  * also reach out to people here, bit of a crossover, but this is scary! Quick looks suggests poor fit for this exact repo:https://github.com/python/docs-community
 
Next:

* Work on broken links (can: remove, annotate, ??), maybe pre-commit hook
* Backfill revision history for active pages

**It seems to be the year of the python wiki!** Independently it seems as though several people/groups have got an interest in this wiki. I am one of those people, though it is only now it's coming to light how many people were interested.

For myself, I wanted to get an understanding of what the wiki "looked Like" to do some analysis on.

Additionally it seemed like fun to see if it was replicable here, using the default wiki available with this tooling, so here we are.


**Completed:**

* âœ… Small django project that contains the all files collected using both linked-graph (this capture to 2025-02-09) and any further from `/moin/TitleIndex` (as recommended from mailing list).
* âœ… Basic overview: contains 2,636 pages and 849 unique contributors
* âœ… Converted all content to markdown
* âœ… List of `active-pages`.
  * Criteria:
    * -> not User pages (don't feel authority on these, though these are hard to identify -> perhaps seperate list of user pages, this is easy and should be done, adding now)
    * arbitrary, I reckon maybe back to around 2016 as ordered by `last edited` date, this is ~400 pages including users, I think will come down to maybe ~250-300
* âœ… List of `user-pages` (easily defined as they will be represented after `last edited by`, with some nuances and likely imperfect)
* âœ… New django model for users (obviously not called users)
* âœ… List of `local-user-group-pages` (as linked per above)
  * all pages linked from https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups âœ¨ irrespective of date
* âœ… Fix white space in md
* âœ… Determine most populated root-node pages, adjust and populate django models as necessary
* âœ… Experiment committing tree structure to github wiki
* âœ… Remove links to redundant wiki `Category__`
* âœ… Pushed up small set to review in github (`event-local-groups`)
* âœ… New directory tree:
  * âœ… `users` directory which will contain all user pages irrespective of date
  * âœ… rest of pages, wip
    * âœ… grouping "organising" v "technical/reference" is challenging
 * âœ… Linking: managed internal linking (`Page.clean_links()` method)
   *  Internal linking is a pain if applying the tree I would like to. Links aren't necessarily preserved. Upon writing it occurs to me that I could step up my use of obsidian as the editor, which would be convenient in a range of ways and not too wild. It will just be a matter of making the commitment to dump out from the django project.
* âœ… Fixed tree structure applying README as necessary
* âœ… Reliable way to move pages (`EuroPython2007` v `EuroPython/2007` problem)
* âœ… late update: upon cleaning up urls 437 previously untouched urls turned up which will need to be collected. I suspect that as I've pinged the channel about it that someone else is also working on this wiki replication effort, as it seems as though server has been down more frequently than I remember. It's handing about 2 requests per minute. Having said this, I don't think what ever comes out now will change anything substantially. -> a mere 7h32m later, we're done.
